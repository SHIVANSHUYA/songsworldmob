                <h2>Lyrics</h2>
                <p>Mic check, Mic check
                <p>Am i al'right? Thanks a lot
                <p>Unh
                <p>Yo! It's Brodha V, some of you might have heard of me,
                <p>I talk about money
                <p>I talk about rap music
                <p>I talk about gettin' high
                <p>But now, I'ma talk about God
                <p>Back in the time,
                <p>When I was lacking a dime
                <p>My hopeless youth had me slowly get attracted to crime
                <p>Then sat an alliance,
                <p>To talk it out with practical minds
                <p>Felt a force within me,
                <p>Get all my talents combined,
                <p>Enacted a mime,
                <p>Enlightened I decided to rhyme,
                <p>Delighted and excited.
                <p>I'm planning to rap till I'm prime.
                <p>Started spilling ink on the paper
                <p>And planned to get signed.
                <p>But the world is biased,
                <p>So wild, they got me slapped with a fine
                <p>I never got a chance,
                <p>Never let me spit on the mic,
                <p>Only cuz I come from a land
                <p>Where people ain't white
                <p>Day and night I keep flowing, completing all my demo tracks,
                <p>Inspite being denied the right by
                <p>Anti-democrats
                <p>Unleash my rage through music intense
                <p>The cultural shock that got my whole community tensed
                <p>That's when I, close my eyes and talk to God
                <p>Peace in my head, I'm singing this song and it goes like
                <p>Aathma Raama Aananda Ramana
                <p>Achyutha Keshava Hari Narayana
                <p>Aathma Raama Aananda Ramana
                <p>Achyutha Keshava Hari Narayana
                <p>Life is an octopus tryna choke you with tentacles
                <p>Survived by only those who prove to be sensible
                <p>With only two choices, good and the bad
                <p>The hardest part is to be choosing a path, check this
                <p>I could've got myself in dealing with drugs
                <p>Or maybe pop a weaker person dead
                <p>While chilling with thugs
                <p>Maybe, blow up my father's money spending on clothes
                <p>Fake an attitude for winning all 'em feminine votes
                <p>One point of time, I got absorbed in foolish lies
                <p>Was juvenile, thought it was cool to get into brutal fights
                <p>I even had the thrilling urge to kill
                <p>The next second, the whole feeling reversed to guilt
                <p>I was offered a gun, that's when I dropped it for a mic
                <p>Took rap as a career and I thought that this was right
                <p>I close my eyes and give my thanks to God
                <p>Peace in my head, I'm singing this song and it goes
                <p>Aathma Raama Aananda Ramana
                <p>Achyutha Keshava Hari Narayana
                <p>Aathma Raama Aananda Ramana
                <p>Achyutha Keshava Hari Narayana
                <p>I'm being frank and I'm speaking my mind naked
                <p>Everyday on my knees, praying to God that I make it
                <p>The only hope that keep me going is I know I'm artistic
                <p>To levels extreme, my haters agree I'm God-gifted
                <p>But that don't mean I lay around like clinical bait
                <p>When its mayhem in my head at such subliminal rate
                <p>Cyclic monotony for me is cursed as debt
                <p>I'm only halfway through the phase between Birth and Death
                <p>One day, I wish to be like
                <p>Eminem
                <p>2Pac
                <p>And have a million people chanting, Brodha V you rock
                <p>And maybe, wish to have a girl like
                <p>Emma Watson
                <p>Or even accept a Grammy on stage while Mama's watching
                <p>But till then, I'mma see days when the weather be rough
                <p>I better be tough, Brodha V gon' never give up
                <p>Now i'ma, Close my eyes and talk to God
                <p>Peace in my head, Imma singing this song and it goes
                <p>Aathma Raama Aananda Ramana
                <p>Achyutha Keshava Hari Narayana
                <p>Aathma Raama Aananda Ramana
                <p>Achyutha Keshava Hari Narayana
