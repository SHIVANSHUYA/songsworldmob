                <p>[Verse 1]
                <p>First things first
                <p>I'ma say all the words inside my head
                <p>I'm fired up and tired of
                <p>The way that things have been, oh-ooh
                <p>The way that things have been, oh-ooh
                <p class="space">sdfffffffffffffffff</p>
                <p>[Verse 2]
                <p>Second things second
                <p>Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
                <p>I'm the one at the sail
                <p>I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
                <p>The master of my sea, oh-ooh
                    <p class="space">sdfffffffffffffffff</p>
                <p>[Pre-Chorus]
                <p>I was broken from a young age
                <p>Taking my sulkin' to the masses
                <p>Writing my poems for the few
                <p>That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
                <p>Singing from heartache from the pain
                <p>Taking my message from the veins
                <p>Speaking my lesson from the brain
                <p>Seeing the beauty through the...
                    <p class="space">sdfffffffffffffffff</p>
                <p>[Chorus]
                <p>Pain! You made me a, you made me a
                <p>Believer, believer
                <p>Pain! You break me down, you build me up
                <p>Believer, believer
                <p>Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
                <p>My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
                <p>Pain! You made me a, you made me a
                <p>Believer, believer
                    <p class="space">sdfffffffffffffffff</p>
                <p>[Verse 3]
                <p>Third things third
                <p>Send a prayer to the ones up above
                <p>All the hate that you've heard
                <p>Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
                <p>Your spirit up above, oh-ooh
                    <p class="space">sdfffffffffffffffff</p>
                <p>[Pre-Chorus]
                <p>I was chokin' in the crowd
                <p>Building my rain up in the cloud
                <p>Falling like ashes to the ground
                <p>Hoping my feelings, they would drown
                <p>But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
                <p>Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
                <p>It rained down, like…
                    <p class="space">sdfffffffffffffffff</p>
                <p>[Chorus]
                <p>Pain! You made me a, you made me a
                <p>Believer, believer
                <p>Pain! You break me down, you build me up
                <p>Believer, believer
                <p>Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
                <p>My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
                <p>Pain! You made me a, you made me a
                <p>Believer, believer

                    <p class="space">sdfffffffffffffffff</p>
                <p>[Verse 4]
                <p>Last things last
                <p>By the grace of the fire and the flames
                <p>You're the face of the future
                <p>The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
                <p>The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
                    <p class="space">sdfffffffffffffffff</p>
                <p>[Pre-Chorus]
                <p>But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
                <p>Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
                <p>It rained down, like…
                    <p class="space">sdfffffffffffffffff</p>
                <p>[Chorus]
                <p>Pain! You made me a, you made me a
                <p>Believer, believer
                <p>Pain! You break me down, you build me up
                <p>Believer, believer
                <p>Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
                <p>My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
                <p>Pain! You made me a, you made me a
