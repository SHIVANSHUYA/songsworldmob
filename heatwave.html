                <p>Last night, all I think about is you
                <p>Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
                <p>Don't wanna, but I think about you
                <p>You know that I'm never gonna lose
                <p>Road shimmer, wiggling the vision
                <p>Heat, heat waves, I'm swimming in a mirror
                <p>Road shimmer, wiggling the vision
                <p>Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
                <p>Sometimes all I think about is you
                <p>Late nights in the middle of June
                <p>Heat waves been faking me out
                <p>Can't make you happier now
                <p>Sometimes all I think about is you
                <p>Late nights in the middle of June
                <p>Heat waves been faking me out
                <p>Can't make you happier now
                <p>Usually, I put something on               <p>So we never think about you and me
                <p>But today, I see our reflections clearly in Hollywood
                <p>Laying on the screen
                <p>You just need a better life than this
                <p>You need something I can never give
                <p>Fake water all across the road
                <p>It's gone now, the night has come, but
                <p>Sometimes all I think about is you
                <p>Late nights in the middle of June
                <p>Heat waves been faking me out
                <p>Can't make you happier now
                <p>You can't fight it, you can't breathe
                <p>You say something so loving, but
                <p>Now I gotta let you go
                <p>You'll be better off with someone new
                <p>I don't wanna be alone
                <p>You know it hurts me too
                <p>You look so broken when you cry
                <p>One more and then I say goodbye
                <p>Sometimes all I think about is you
                <p>Late nights in the middle of June
                <p>Heat waves been faking me out
                <p>Can't make you happier now
                <p>Sometimes all I think about is you
                <p>Late nights in the middle of June
                <p>Heat waves been faking me out
                <p>Can't make you happier now
                <p>I just wonder what you're dreaming of
                <p>When you sleep and smile so comfortable
                <p>I just wish that I could give you that
                <p>That look that's perfectly un-sad
                <p>Sometimes all I think about is you
                <p>Late nights in the middle of June
                <p>Heat waves been faking me out
                <p>Heat waves been faking me out
                <p>Sometimes all I think about is you
                <p>Late nights in the middle of June
                <p>Heat waves been faking me out
                <p>Can't make you happier now
                <p>Sometimes all I think about is you
                <p>Late nights in the middle of June
                <p>Heat waves been faking me out
                <p>Can't make you happier now
                <p>Road shimmer wiggling the vision
                <p>Heat, heat waves, I'm swimming in a mirror
                <p>Road shimmer wiggling the vision
                <p>Heat, heat waves, I'm swimming in a mirror
